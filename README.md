# WP Wireframe Plugin

***Clone it. Extend it. Sell it.***

WP Wireframe Plugin (WPWFP) is an OOP boilerplate starter plugin for WordPress. WPWFP enables WordPress Developers to rapidly wire plugin features and release GPL and WPCS compliant plugins for professional client projects or for selling premium plugins in any marketplace. WPWFP can be forked as a standalone repo or as a submodule packaged with the [Wireframe](https://github.com/mixatheme/Wireframe) suite for WordPress by ![MIXA Logo](https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/16634291?v=3&s=16) [MixaTheme](https://mixatheme.com).

## Requirements

We encourage Developers to use the requirements listed below, but this is ultimately up to each Developer or Team. Due to the rapid advancement of tech these days, WPWFP will generally support software no more than 2 major point releases behind.

1. LAMP, LEMP or any server running PHP, MySQL or MariaDB.
2. **PHP version 5.6** or greater is highly recommended.
3. MySQL version 5.5 or greater OR MariaDB version 10.0 or greater.
4. WordPress version 4.6 or greater.
5. Intermediate knowledge of the [Wordpress Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org) and [Theme Development](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development) guides.

**Please note: if you receive errors upon theme activation, it's most likey due to an incompatible PHP version. We currently only support PHP 5.6+ but if there is enough demand, we will consider older PHP versions.**
